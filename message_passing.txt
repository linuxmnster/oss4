Message Passing:
Definition: A method where processes communicate by sending and receiving messages.
How it works: One process sends data (a message) to another, which can be asynchronous or synchronous.
Pros:
Simple and modular.
No need for synchronization mechanisms, as the operating system handles message queues.
Cons:
Slower than shared memory due to the overhead of copying messages.


Shared Memory:
Definition: A method where multiple processes can access the same region of memory for communication.
How it works: Processes map a shared region of memory into their address space, allowing them to read and write data directly.
Pros:
Faster than message passing because there is no need to copy data.
Efficient for large amounts of data.
Cons:
Requires synchronization (e.g., semaphores, mutexes) to avoid conflicts (race conditions).
